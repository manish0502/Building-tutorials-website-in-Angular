              <p>The Angular is the newest form of the AngularJS, developed by Google, which is an open-source front-end development platform used for building mobile and desktop web applications. Angular is rewritten by the same team that built AngularJS.</p>
                              <p>It is a JavaScript framework for building web applications and apps in JavaScript, HTML, and TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript.
